    A general overhaul mod for Halo: Combat Evolved
</p>

# Introduction

2K19 is an overhaul mod for Halo PC which improves the user experience in 3 ways:
 - visual enhancement (weapons, menu, HUD, ...)
 - rebalancing the mechanics of the game
 - various fixes and resolution improvements (thanks to Chimera)
2K19's main goal is to make new players want to play this game, while moving away as
little as possible form the lore of the game. Halo 1 is one of the very best Halo
game, it must be respected. This documentation should assist in setting up 2K19.
