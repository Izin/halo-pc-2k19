# Introduction

2K20 is an overhaul mod for Halo PC which improves the user experience in 3 ways:
 - textures: visual enhancement (weapons, menu, HUD, ...)
 - behaviours: rebalancing the mechanics of the game in campaign
 - third-party software: external fixes and improvements
2K20's main goal is to make new players want to play this game, while moving away as
little as possible form the lore of the game. Halo 1 is one of the very best Halo
game, it must be respected. This documentation should assist in setting up 2K20.

# Know bugs

- Behaviour/Campaign: plasma rifle has a lot less rpm after it reaches 50% of available energy [BUG not introduced by 2K20]
- Behaviour/117: increasing walking speed causes side effects, such as "jumps on collision"
- Behaviour/Loaded plasma shot: increasing the velocity of the projectile makes it difficult to follow any target
- Texture/Needer: ammo counter on HUD is broken since magazine capacity has been increased to 22
- Texture/Jackal: texture of the upper jaw's teeth collide each other
- Texture/Sand: on some maps, the color is too damn pronunced (literally gold color on blood gulch)
- Texture/Main menu: given that Reach main menu is not finalized, it can be tricky to use it in some ways
